# 🛒 POS System Team Project
### Software Engineering | Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (Java)

---

## 📘 Overview
This project is part of a Software Engineering course focused on Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD).  
Our team is developing a **Point of Sale (POS) System**, similar to those used in retail environments, allowing sales transactions, product management, and receipt generation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Design and implement a small but functional part of a POS System using Java OOP principles and UML modeling.  
The project will demonstrate:
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- System decomposition into classes and interactions
